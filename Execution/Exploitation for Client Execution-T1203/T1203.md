# Technique Description

## T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution 
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203/)
<blockquote>
Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.[1]

# Assumption
This technique is difficult to monitor with the tools we have discussed. As it requires understanding of the anticipated and normal behavior of software on the end point. Recommended by ATT&CK is to look for indicators of compromise on an endpoint then corelate with unusual or suspicious behavior.
