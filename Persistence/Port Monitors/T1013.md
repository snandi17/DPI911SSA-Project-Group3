## T1013 -  Port Monitors 
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129/)
<blockquote>
A port monitor can be set through the [1] API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup. [1] This DLL can be located in C:\Windows\System32 and will be loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, on boot. The spoolsv.exe process also runs under SYSTEM level permissions. [2] Alternatively, an arbitrary DLL can be loaded if permissions allow writing a fully-qualified pathname for that DLL to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors. The Registry key contains entries for the following: Local Port Standard TCP/IP Port USB Monitor WSD Port
